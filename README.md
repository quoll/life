# Life

Clojure Version of APL Life.

This is a reimplementation of the REPL driven APL implementation
shown on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4

To it in action, just execute `lein run`.

## The Demo Code

The APL REPL session is reinterpreted in the `src/life/demo.clj`
file.

After watching the video I figured that it shouldn't be too hard
to replicate in Clojure, plus it was a good opportunity to
familiarize myself with `core.matrix`.

The demo file duplicates the APL steps as closely as possible,
alongside a transcript of the original dialog in comments.
Where Clojure differs, due to the lack of a built-in function, or
where another approach works better, then the comments describe
the changes, or shows both methods. Any missing functionality has
been provided in `life.matrix`.

The file is runnable, but since it prints the intermediate matrices
as part of the tutorial, it is really designed for interaction with
a REPL. The final implementation is duplicated in `life.core`,
which is what is executed with `lein run`.

## Other Namespaces

`life.matrix` includes several matric functions to help implement
the APL approach, such as an operation for converting boolean
true/false to 1/0. There are also other APL-style boolean operations
that work on 1/0 and can be applied to matrices. Finally, there are
a couple of non-matrix operations, such as the `power` operator for
functions and `power-limit` for finding a fixpoint.

`life.display` does simple printing of a 2D matrix, similarly to
the `disp` function in the APL video.

`life.pic` contains simple Swing code that creates a window for
displaying a world matrix. The Swing code uses a simple global value
for displaying the matrix as this allowed me to keep it simple and
avoid compiling any classes. (I'm not proud of it, but it suits its
purpose).
